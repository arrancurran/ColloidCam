# microTool Project Structure Improvements

This document outlines suggested improvements to the microTool project structure to enhance maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## 1. Dependency Injection

Current Issue:

- The `microTool` class creates all dependencies directly in `__init__`
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to test individual components

Suggested Solution:

- Implement dependency injection
- Create interfaces for major components
- Pass dependencies through constructors
- Use a dependency injection container

## 2. Configuration Management

Current Issue:

- No clear configuration management system
- Settings scattered across different files
- Difficult to manage different environments

Suggested Solution:

```
config/
├── __init__.py
├── default.py      # Default settings
├── production.py   # Production environment settings
└── development.py  # Development environment settings
```

## 3. Service Layer

Current Issue:

- Mixed concerns between UI, business logic, and hardware interaction
- Direct coupling between components
- Difficult to modify individual layers

Suggested Solution:

```
interface/ (UI Layer)
    ↓
services/ (Business Logic Layer)
    ↓
instruments/ (Hardware Layer)
```

## 4. Event System

Current Issue:

- Direct signal connections
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to add new features

Suggested Solution:

```
events/
├── __init__.py
├── event_bus.py
└── events/
    ├── camera_events.py
    ├── recording_events.py
    └── ui_events.py
```

## 5. Error Handling

Current Issue:

- Inconsistent error handling
- No centralized error management
- Difficult to debug issues

Suggested Solution:

```
core/
├── exceptions/
│   ├── camera_exceptions.py
│   ├── recording_exceptions.py
│   └── ui_exceptions.py
└── error_handler.py
```

## 6. Logging System

Current Issue:

- Basic print statements for logging
- No structured logging
- Difficult to debug issues

Suggested Solution:

```
core/
└── logging/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── logger.py
    └── handlers/
        ├── file_handler.py
        └── console_handler.py
```

## 7. Plugin Architecture

Current Issue:

- Hard-coded camera implementations
- Difficult to add new camera types
- Limited extensibility

Suggested Solution:

```
instruments/
├── base/
│   └── instrument_base.py
├── xicam/
│   └── ...
└── noCam/
    └── ...
```

## 8. State Management

Current Issue:

- Distributed state management
- Unpredictable state changes
- Difficult to debug state-related issues

Suggested Solution:

```
core/
└── state/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── state_manager.py
    └── states/
        ├── camera_state.py
        └── recording_state.py
```

## 9. Testing Structure

Current Issue:

- Basic test organization
- Limited test coverage
- Difficult to maintain tests

Suggested Solution:

```
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
└── e2e/
```

## 10. Documentation

Current Issue:

- Limited documentation
- No clear documentation structure
- Difficult for new developers to understand the system

Suggested Solution:

```
docs/
├── api/
├── architecture/
├── development/
└── user_guide/
```

## Benefits of These Improvements

1. **Modularity**
   - Components are more independent
   - Easier to modify individual parts
   - Better separation of concerns

2. **Testability**
   - Easier to write unit tests
   - Better isolation of components
   - More comprehensive test coverage

3. **Scalability**
   - Easier to add new features
   - Better support for multiple camera types
   - More flexible architecture

4. **Robustness**
   - Better error handling
   - More predictable state management
   - Improved logging and debugging

5. **Maintainability**
   - Clearer code organization
   - Better documentation
   - Easier to understand and modify

6. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture for new features
   - Event system for loose coupling
   - Better support for future enhancements

## Implementation Priority

1. Configuration Management
2. Logging System
3. Error Handling
4. Service Layer
5. State Management
6. Event System
7. Dependency Injection
8. Plugin Architecture
9. Testing Structure
10. Documentation

## Next Steps

1. Create a detailed implementation plan
2. Set up a development branch for restructuring
3. Implement changes incrementally
4. Add tests for new components
5. Update documentation as changes are made
6. Perform thorough testing
7. Plan for a smooth transition

## Notes

- Changes should be implemented gradually to maintain system stability
- Each improvement should be thoroughly tested before integration
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes
- Consider backward compatibility during transition
- Plan for proper training and documentation for team members
